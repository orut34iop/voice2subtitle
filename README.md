  v2s turns microphone input or app audio into a clean two-line subtitle bar so you can follow speech in one language and read it in another without leaving the screen you are already using.

## Why v2s

- Follow live conversations with translated subtitles pinned at the top of your screen.
- Capture from your microphone or from a specific macOS app instead of your entire system mix.
- Keep the original speech and the translated line visible together for fast context switching.
- Stay in a lightweight menu bar workflow instead of juggling browser tabs or full-screen caption apps.

## Features

- Menu bar app built for always-available subtitle access.
- Live subtitle overlay with translated text on the first line and source text on the second.
- Audio source selection for microphones and running macOS apps.
- On-device speech transcription powered by Apple SpeechAnalyzer.
- On-device translation powered by Apple Translation.
- Transcript summarization powered by Apple Intelligence for quick overview of conversations.
- Overlay styling controls so the subtitle bar stays readable on top of real work.

## Input Languages

v2s only lists input languages supported by Apple's SpeechAnalyzer/SpeechTranscriber path. Regional variants are not exposed in the UI; v2s chooses a default supported region for each language.

Supported input languages: Cantonese, Chinese (Simplified), English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.

## Privacy

- No account, cloud backend, analytics, or telemetry.
- Audio and subtitle text never leave your Mac through v2s.
- Translation uses Apple's on-device Translation framework. Some language packs may need to be downloaded first through System Settings.
- Speech recognition uses Apple's on-device SpeechAnalyzer/SpeechTranscriber resources for the listed input languages.

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest `.app.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/franklioxygen/v2s/releases).
2. Unzip and move `v2s.app` to your Applications folder.
3. Launch v2s — it appears as an icon in your menu bar.
4. Select an input source (a running app or microphone).
5. Choose your input and subtitle languages.
6. Click **Start**.

v2s will ask for permissions on first use:

- **Speech Recognition** — to transcribe audio into text.
- **Microphone** — when using a microphone as the input source.
- **Audio Capture** — when capturing audio from another app.

## Requirements

- Speech transcription and translation require macOS 26 or newer

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/franklioxygen/v2s.git
cd v2s
open v2s.xcodeproj
```

Or from the terminal:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh Debug
```

## Development checks

`./scripts/build.sh Release` builds the macOS arm64 app at `.build/app/Build/Products/Release/v2s.app`. Build scripts stamp the local build time (`yyyyMMddHHmm`) into both the Xcode project and AppModel.

- `./scripts/test.sh`: run the Xcode app test target; its host skips update checks and production instance locking.
- `./scripts/test.sh --swiftpm`: run the same SwiftPM regression tests.
- `python3 scripts/verify-project.py`: check source and test registration parity between build systems.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s Tests/BuildTools`: verify build timestamp and release version validation.

CI runs both test entry points and builds the arm64 release app. Releases run regression tests before packaging. Full transcripts are independent of the live display queue; long summaries are generated in chunks and show their coverage time.
